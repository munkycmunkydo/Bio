        <h1> Craig's Bio </h1>
        <br>
        My interest in technology begun at a very early age, it started with the Commodore 128 [1] to the point where I now find myself surrounded by technology. I'm an early adopter of technologies, in a constant struggle to fund what has become a habit with technology becoming ever more expensive.
        I have over 10 years' experience working in telecommunications, Software, IT and Cyber-security. When in telecommunications, Tech Guru's where asking for my advice as much as I was asking for theirs.
        When I working in Software, the Director of UX had this to say about me "He has a very good grasp of technology and how it can be used effectively in today's business world. In addition, he has a keen eye for detail and was constantly making suggestions or reporting issues (big or small) during development, especially on his personal time."[2].
        In IT I was constantly learning about new technologies and how businesses leverage these technologies with a focus on End User Compute, Servers and Storage. Working in Cyber-security give me a new perspective on technology, how it can be misused and why information security needs to be higher on the agenda for every business.<br>
        <br>
        The penny started to drop when I was working for an IT Supplier, why was I working in sales when I was more technically minded? Money.<br>
        <br>
        When I become father, life changed. I now measured my success on what my son achieves in life, naturally I want to be an positive influence on him but have his own identity. I'm a firm believer that happiness is contagious, working in sales wasn't making me happy and I needed a change. I wanted a role that required knowledge I could pass onto my son, I explored a few options with software development was one.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started self-learning C++, not the easiest entry path however I found it to be something I enjoyed. I began researching other languages which raised questionsâ€¦. when I gain all this knowledge what would I enjoy doing with it? What would be the best path to get there? Could I get a job if I learn this language?<br>
        My research lead me to Code Nation [3], I needed to take a step back and look at the core principles of software development and understand where I am at before making the decision where to go. <br>
