    <h3> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business. </h3>
        The role of technology in business is expanding, to stay relevant in a digital world businesses need to embrace the benefits of technology. Business efficiency is greatly improved with the use of technology, when augmented within operations it can reduce the time to completion by automating tasks, enable multitasking and collaboration which increases the output of a business.
    </p>
    <h3> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully. </h3>
    <p>
        There are many different methods, skills and resources we can use to complete digital projects. Considering the simplicity or complexity of the project, the working environment, team experience and what deliveries the most value helps a team choose a method, identify skills and what will provide more value to the client. Popular project management methodologies include Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Lean and Waterfall which each have their advantages and disadvantages for particular projects and need to be considered carefully. The tools used may differ per method and project, to crease collaboration tools such as Zoom, Teams, Slack, Project, Trello and GitHub are available each having functionality to allow a team to work smarter and more efficiently.

    <h3> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website. </h3>
    <p>
        Upon receiving the brief for my task to make my own website I needed to answer some of my own questions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Content?<br>
        What style did I want the content, formal or personal and did I want to include my own theories or remain factual.<br>
        Design?<br>
        Bells and whistles or simple, how do I want users to navigate around the website and green or blue?<br>
        Deadline?<br>
        How much time do I have, how long will it take me to research and produce the content and design? What takes priority and suits my own creative style.<br>
        <br>
        Once these questions have been answered I then looked at the tools to enable me to carry out the task. Accessibility and functionality being key to my decisions.<br>
        <br>
        Zoom - To communicate with my tutor to ask questions and share ideas over video.<br>
        Slack - To share code and ideas over text.<br>
        Trello - To plan and track my progress over project and allow my instructor to guide me further.<br>
        Visual Studio - To write my code.<br>
        Chrome - To research.
    </p>
    <h3> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects. </h3>
    <p>
        The risks that can impact a digital project can depend on many factors such as the quality of the scope, capability of the team, collaboration, plan and management. Research suggests that teams that focus on outcome in development and happy to change if required, put the user needs first and collaborate with other teams are more successful in delivering a digital project. Whilst teams that are working from a poorly defined initial scope, allow short term priorities to take over, take on more capacity than available and do not collaborate with other teams are more likely to fail. Having a good defined initial scope allows a team develop a higher quality to plan which increases the chance for success, processes to be put in place to allow for flexibility, involve the client more and make actions on their feedback and liaise with other teams to discuss what support and time they can offer to support the project.

    <h3> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software. </h3>
    <p>
        When deciding of IT systems and software I consider what will allow me to be more efficiently and work collaboratively with cost and security being a factor. I look at what I have currently, what I have used before and research technologies that have been recommended recently or seen a surge in user adoption. I look to speak to people in the industry what they use, why they use it and what they think is missing. I'd use all the information gained to make an informed choice what IT systems and software to use and prioritise based on what will allow me to do the job efficiently and at the highest quality.
    </p>
    <h3> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </h3>
    <p>
        I've used Trello to manage my project, to plan and track where I am against that plan and shared access with my tutor to review and seek support on my content for the website and design ideas. I've used Slack and Zoom to communicate with my tutor for guidance of the content and design on the website. Visual Studio code was really helpful as it highlights errors made and explore different the Syntax further. I used GitHub to save my versions and I created a GitHub Pages site to share my work and check it operated as intended within a web browser.<br>
    </p>
    <h3> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects. </h3>
    <p>
        Legal guidelines impact digital projects in many ways, the most prominent guidelines being the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1] and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) [2].<br>
        <br>
        GDPR supersedes the Data Protection Act 1998 and is set out of 7 key principles.<br>
        <br>
        - Lawfulness, fairness and transparency<br>
        - Purpose limitation<br>
        - Data minimisation<br>
        - Accuracy<br>
        - Storage limitation<br>
        - Integrity and confidentiality (Security)<br>
        - Accountability<br>
        <br>
        The PECR sits alongside the Data Protection Act and the GDPR, it gives people specific privacy rights in relation to electronic communications.<br>
        <br>
        - Marketing calls, emails, texts and faxes<br>
        - Cookies (and similar technologies)<br>
        - Keeping communications services secure; and customer privacy as regards traffic and location data, itemised billing, line identification, and directory listings<br>
        <br>
        These guidelines need to be considered throughout a digital project to ensure you remain compliant and operate within the bounds of these regulations.<br>
