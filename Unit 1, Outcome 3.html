        <h3> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efciency – could you have been more efcient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  </h3>
        The tools and systems I use allowed me to be efficient, Visual Code helped me with the CSS syntax, GitHub gave me an area for version control and to back up my data. My hardware include an i5, 8GB, 256GB SSD Windows tablet, 24" monitor with a mouse and keyboard with height adjustability making working at length easier and minimal waiting when using applications. One drawback I have was my chair, as I was working from home I was working from the kitchen table rather than desk and comfortable chair, however I was sat 1 meter away from the coffee machine which increased productivity. <br>
        <br>
         Working as a team would have improved the content and design of the website, although due to multiple preferences being involved it would have radically changed the design and change from my intended outcome as an individual. As a team, tasks could have been assigned to different members allowing more time to be spent on the content and design to improve it further as the strengths and weaknesses of team members could be utilised.  <br>
        <br>
        <h3> 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency  </h3>
        To improve my productivity and efficiency my first step was to find a workspace in the house and my partner is working from home also, we agreed for me to take the kitchen to enable me to have a dual monitor set up. Having dual monitors allowed me to multitask and when I made changes to the code I could see the changes to the website side by side live. I took regular breaks to clear my head and make a coffee which increased my focus and allowed me to think my project through without making any changes or influences from my research to focus on what I wanted to achieve. Planning my project and setting myself a goal what I wanted to achieve per day helped my motivation and keep me on track to publish the website the standard I set myself.<br>
        <h3> 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
            would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3>
        To improve productivity I would plan my project different, pick the project methodologies carefully and assign tasks more efficiently and improve the brief so the team produces uniform content. To improve my personal productivity I would have improved my workspace, bigger screens, height adjustability options with a suitable desk and chair which would allow me to work longer and efficiently. I would have used Trello more and utilised it capabilities to improve teamwork by breaking down the brief  further and going more granular on the development stages to improve efficiency and meet the requirements set out in the brief.<br>
        <br>
        <h3> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions. </h3>
        To test a solutions I would run it myself testing all the functions to ensure the work as intended, if working as a team having each member doing the same to improve efficiently as overlooked mistakes will be reduced. As a team sharing thoughts of the project and the experience can help identify change that can be made to improve the solutions further and ensure it matches the requirements set out in the brief. Having other people who have digital solution knowledge can give further insight as they may have had experiences with a similar solution to compare or they may have gone about things differently. Having user a user who has no digital solutions can give further insight on the user experience such as presentation and ease of use.
