    <h3> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites. </h3>
        <p>
        Websites are generally publicly available, the risk of content and images be stolen is high as it's so easy which is why it's important to include a copyright notice on each. Each page should contain a notice in visible text or a link to your notice, each file should contain a notice in non-visible text. You need ensure you do not use any copyrighted content without the rights or license otherwise you would be infringing yourself.<br>
        <br>
        When creating a website for a third party, you need to ensure rights are transferred or licensed to the third party and think about if you want credited on the website for your work. Copyright registration is important and needs to be complete as soon as possible and ideally before the website is published. [1] <br>

    <h3> 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. </h3>
    <p>
        People with disabilities come up against many barriers in their lives, accessing the internet should not be one and a medical approach alone cannot guarantee accessibility to people with disabilities. There are other ways to overcome these barriers and enable a disabled user to use the internet as effectively as a person without a disability.  The barriers faced can differ depending on the type and degree of the disability, the barriers can range from not being able to read text due to a visual impairment to being unable to join an online conference due to an hearing impairment. [1]<br>
        <br>
        There are many assistive technologies available to break down these barriers, here are some examples. [2]<br>
            <br>
        - Braille Keyboard and Display<br> 
        - Screen Magnifier<br>
        - High Contrast<br>
        - Friendly Fonts<br>
        - Text to Speech<br>
        - Hands free mouse systems<br>
        - Video Captions<br>
        <br>
        Developers have a responsibility to ensure their website is accessible and work well with these assistive technologies with some of these such as high contrast, video captions and fonts something they can implement.<br>

    <h3> 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites. </h3>
    <p>
        The internet is accesses using a range of devices, operating systems and web browsers, a challenge for web developers is to make their website compatible with all or as many of them as possible. Some file formats are recognised as usable on their web due to their compatibility with web browsers. Common formats for pictures are JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG, for video MP4 and PDF for documents which only a small portion of the file types available on the web.[1]<br>
