        <h3> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
            your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,
            Trello. </h3>
            I'm happy with the tools used, Visual Studio Code is simple and easy to use and I have used it before, Trello has helped me keep on top of the project and execute my plan. I used OneNote to write my content, it automatically adds the reference when you paste information from the web which saved time. I was using the web browser to find images but I was unhappy with the quality of free images than I could use, I switched to using MS Paint 3D to create images which saved time and provided the quality images I required. Zoom and Slack where easy to use and I encountered no technical difficulties when liaising with my tutor. GitHub give me a safe place to store my work and undo any unintended mistakes made in Visual Studio Code, it also helped with testing the site in Chrome and how a website function when the data is not local on the system.<br>
        <br>

    <h3> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
        Trello. </h3>
        The tools I selected enabled me to build my website, Visual Studio Code saved me time debugging and OneNote auto added references which saved me an extra paste action. The tools used where effective and allowed me to work more efficiently to complete my task and where tools I have used before so there was no learning curve using them to their full potential.<br>
        <br>
        <p>
    <h3> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
        your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests
        of openness. What would you change? </h3>
        I'm happy with my website, I want a simple clean design and that is what I achieved. The website does need further improvement to support a mobile browser, more media for user friendliness and accessibility changes. With more time I would have utilised CSS flexbox more, added drop down menu's and presented the text in a more palatable format. My strength is in the navigation and design, my weakness is functionality and a the lack of rich media on the website.<br>
        <br>
    <h3> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project. </h3>
    To improve my website further I would utilise flexbox to have pictures alongside text, format the text to be into columns to increase readability and presentation. If I had more content on the website I would have added drop down menu's for further sub menus to improve navigation and presentation further. With flexbox I could have added more design features to the website to add more colour and separate the questions and answers is a presentable and professional format. In the planning phase, I would have researched CSS further and used my knowledge to improve the design phases and have a concise plan on the design.<br>

    <h3> 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h3>
    My website design and content matches the requirements, the content I was asked to include has been presented on a web page in a clean, professional design and navigation around the website is simple and accessible. The requirements where considered throughout the project to ensure the outcomes.<br>
